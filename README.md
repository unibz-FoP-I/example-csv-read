This code shows how access and parse a formatted file without the `scanf` family of functions. CSV parsing is somewhat na√Øve (e.g. doesn't support quoting) and it assume ASCII encoding of the data.

The data is taken from [Mappa dei relitti in Italia](http://www.datiopen.it/en/opendata/Mappa_dei_relitti_in_Italia) and available in the `data` directory.
